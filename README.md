### Development Branch Sequence  
  
  **dev** - Development branch. All production code that will be produced/used/implemented are going to be on this branch.    

  **test** - Testing branch. Form validation, entry and exit point checking, javascript functions, spellcheck, grammar, styling, etc. are all going to be tested on this branch, and will determine release candidates. **NO CODE SHALL PASS FROM TEST->MASTER WITHOUT THOROUGH TESTING.**
    
  **master** - Passed release candidate. Merged from `test` branch to `master`. Fully functioning, production code. :)
